This data was uploaded by William Weldon on June 11, 2020 and was generated by : William Weldon1, Brian K. Knaus2, Niklaus Gr√ºnwald3, Joshua M. Havill4, Mary H. Block2, David H. Gent4, Lance Cadle-Davidson1,6, and David M. Gadoury1.

This repository contains the raw Illumina sequencing files necessary to use the collection of 320 Podosphaera macularis individuals
used in the Weldon et al. 2020 manuscript (Transcriptome-derived amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) markers elucidate the U.S. Podosphaera macularis population structure across feral and commercial plantings of Humulus lupulus)
as the baseline comparison for any additional amplicon sequencing reads output from a P. macularis population of your own.
This repository also contains a file for the top allele sequence output across each of the 54 target SNP loci for the 320 P. macularis samples run through the AmpSeq pipeline that survived all filtering restrictions.
This repository also contains the forward and reverse primer sequences for each of the top 54 AmpSeq marker loci.
